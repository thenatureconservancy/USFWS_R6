## Goals of this demonstration

![USFWS Region 6 Fire Zones.](images/fire_zones.jpg){style="float:right; margin-left: 25px;" fig-alt="\"Historical ecosystems map of a large region in the western United States." fig-align="right" width="500" }

We will use [LANDFIRE](https://landfire.gov/){target="blank"} products to:


1. Characterize  past and present ecosystem conditions.
2. Quantify historical acres burned for the USFWS tracts within each Fire Zone to support fire management planning by USFWS Region 6.
3. Provide basic LANDFIRE documentation and background.

## Overview of LANDFIRE Inputs

In the USFWS Fire Zone tabs we used two basic types of LANDFIRE Data, 1) Biophysical Settings and 2) Existing Vegetation.

USFWS Fire Zones and Tracts data for Region 6 provided by Sonya Feaster, GIS analysist with the USFWS.


### Historical Context with LANDFIRE's Biophysical Settings (BpSs)

> *BpS  represent the vegetation system that may have been dominant on the landscape prior to Euro-American settlement. These models are based on a combination of the current environment and an approximation of the historical disturbance regime.* [Read more](https://landfire.gov/bps.php){target="blank"}.

Check out this 3-minute tutorial for a quick refresher on the [basics of Biophysical Settings Models](https://youtu.be/xjaWJCe7udQ){target="blank"}.

We used the BpS models and descriptions to calculate historical acres burned per year, and to explore how many acres burned per BpS per year. 


### Current Landscape with the Existing Vegetation Datasets 

LANDFIRE's [Existing Vegetation Type, Cover and Height](https://landfire.gov/vegetation.php){target="blank"} datasets describe vegetation conditions.

-   Existing Vegetation Type (EVT) - represents the current distribution of the terrestrial ecological systems classification, developed by NatureServe for the western hemisphere, through 2016.
-   Existing Vegetation Cover (EVC) - represents the vertically projected percent cover of the live canopy layer for a 30-m cell.
-   Existing Vegetation Height (EVH) - represents the average height of the dominant vegetation for a 30-m cell.
